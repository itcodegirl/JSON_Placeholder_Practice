What is JSONPlaceholder?
JSONPlaceholder is a free online REST API that you can use to fetch fake data in JSON format. It's useful for testing and prototyping without setting up a backend.

Data Types and Endpoints:
The service offers typical data types you might need in a web application, such as users, posts, comments, albums, photos, and todos. Each type has its own endpoint, like /posts, /users, /comments, etc.

Usage:
You can make HTTP requests to JSONPlaceholder's endpoints to perform actions like getting data (GET), adding new data (POST), updating data (PUT/PATCH), and deleting data (DELETE). These operations mimic interacting with a real API.

Example:
If you want to get a list of posts, you could send a GET request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts. This request would return a JSON array of post objects.

Common Use Cases:

Testing AJAX calls in a frontend application without a real backend.
Prototyping a new feature to see how it might interact with backend data.
Learning how to work with REST APIs without building a backend.
JSONPlaceholder is a valuable tool for frontend developers who want to focus on the frontend logic and design while still being able to interact with an API as if it were a real backend.
